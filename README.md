## üìå Project Workflow

### **1. Topic Selection**
- **Research Focus**:
  - Review **recent research papers** (2024 or later) to identify gaps or areas for improvement.
  - Use these resources for inspiration:
    - **Sifat Momen Sir‚Äôs Papers**: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sGVZEaAAAAAJ&hl=en)
    - **Leila Ismail‚Äôs Papers**: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=TY-2fcUAAAAJ&hl=en)
    - International faculty profiles and references.
  - Explore **Bangladesh-centric datasets and topics** via [RIC Database](https://ric.gov.bd).
- **Goal**:
  - Choose a meaningful and impactful topic with room for improvement or innovation.
  - Ensure the topic aligns with recent trends and has sufficient research material.

---

### **2. Dataset Selection**
- **Key Considerations**:
  - **Novelty**: Datasets should be minimally explored with only a few recent publications (2024 or later).
  - **Relevance**: Focus on datasets that align with the chosen topic and project goals.
- **Dataset Sources**:
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/): Look for unique datasets.
  - Kaggle: Only use competition-level datasets or augment basic datasets with additional features or preprocessing.
- **Process**:
  - Cross-check dataset availability with publications on similar topics to ensure compatibility.

---

### **3. Research**
- Search for **publications** related to your chosen topic using tools like **Google Scholar**.
- Identify and explore references and datasets cited in those papers.
- Combine insights from multiple sources to refine the project proposal and methodology.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### **Steps to Complete the Project**:
1. **Topic Research**:
   - Identify a problem or gap in the current research.
   - Choose a dataset that supports the topic.
2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Clean the data and perform feature engineering.
   - Ensure the dataset is ready for model training.
3. **Model Experimentation**:
   - Implement multiple machine learning models and compare performance.
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the chosen task.
4. **Model Selection and Optimization**:
   - Select the model that performs best on the dataset.
   - Fine-tune the model for better accuracy and efficiency.
5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model on a web-based platform for accessibility.
   - Provide a functional and user-friendly interface.
6. **Documentation**:
   - Prepare a project report following the **IEEE format**.
   - Include methodology, results, and deployment details.
