# GridGenius: AI-Powered Energy Optimization

**Project Goal:** GridGenius is an AI-Powered Energy Optimization System designed to accurately forecast daily energy demand in Bangladesh using historical data. By predicting demand accurately, energy generation can be optimized to meet needs efficiently, reducing waste and costs.

**The Problem:** Inefficient energy management leads to several issues:
*   Electricity is expensive.
*   Supply-demand mismatch causes problems.
*   Wastage of resources occurs when generation exceeds actual need.
*   Increased bills for consumers.
*   Load shedding (power outages) when demand exceeds supply.

**The GridGenius Solution (What If?):**
*   Provide **accurate demand** forecasts.
*   Enable **optimized energy** generation.
*   Offer **LLM-powered insights** into energy patterns.
*   Help **minimize costs** associated with generation and consumption.
*   Contribute to a **lower carbon footprint** through efficiency.
*   Present information via an **interactive platform**.

**Core Concept - Ideal Generation:**
Based on the predicted demand, GridGenius calculates the **Ideal Generation** required. This isn't an exact match for demand but includes a safety margin (e.g., 10% or 5-15%) to account for peak loads, emergency reserves, prevent shortages, and ensure reliability. Comparing this Ideal Generation to Actual Generation helps identify areas for improvement in optimization strategies. Analysis shows that while actual generation has become more efficient compared to 2020-2022, there's still significant room for improvement, especially during Lower Temperature Seasons.
