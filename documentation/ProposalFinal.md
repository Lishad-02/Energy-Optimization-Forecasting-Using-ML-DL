## **Proposed Novelty:**

1. **Real-Time Prediction & Visualization:** Interactive web dashboard with live updates.
2. **LLM-Powered Insights:** Users can interact with an AI assistant to query predictions and trends.
3. **Scalability:** The model can be extended to other cities with minimal adaptation.

## **Other potential Novelty Factors:**
### **A. Hybrid Model Stacking**
- Combine different machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA + LSTM + XGBoost) in a stacked ensemble to leverage their strengths and improve forecasting accuracy.
Stacked hybrid approaches are relatively underexplored in energy demand forecasting.
### **B. Explainable AI (XAI) Integration**
- Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to provide interpretability to the energy demand predictions.
- Novelty: Many ML projects lack transparency; adding XAI can improve trust and stakeholder confidence.
### **C. Feature Engineering with External Data Sources**
- Integrate additional public datasets such as:
  - Economic indicators (GDP, industrial growth).
  - Real-time weather data (API integrations).
  - Social activity trends (e.g., public holidays, festivals).
- Novelty: Combining diverse external data improves the robustness of forecasting models.
### **D. Demand Forecasting with Scenario-Based Simulations**
- Develop simulation models to analyze how various factors (e.g., weather changes, policy shifts) could impact future demand scenarios.
- Novelty: Providing scenario-based insights makes the project more useful for policy-making.
