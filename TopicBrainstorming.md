#### Description
- **Overview**: Agentic AI is related to AI that can make its own decisions in order to achieve a specific goal, without constant human intervention. It solves problems where constant human intervention is inefficient, like, say navigation, or even becoming a personalized AI assistant.
- **Potential Impact**: It gives us a glimpse into a future with AI we can 'depend' on. One where we have AI that 'thinks for us'.
- **Novelty**: Only in the past 2 years has this topic been explored greatly. It serves as a great entry point where a lot of further research is possible. Furthermore, we're starting to see big shifts in Inference time computing combined with Agentic AI for newer LLMs.

## ‚úÖ Final Topic Selection Criteria
- **Novelty**: Is the topic unexplored or minimally researched?
- **Difficulty**: Is the topic challenging enough to warrant a group project by 4 people?
- **Impact**: Does it address a significant issue or contribute meaningfully to the field?
### *(Optional things to consider):*
- **Dataset Availability**: Are there sufficient datasets available for this topic? **(this criteria is optional as we may create our own dataset by web-scraping, or adding to/updating an existing one, making for a much better project)**
- **Feasibility**: Can it be completed within the given timeline and resources? **(this criteria is optional because we have 4 people on our team. come on.)**
