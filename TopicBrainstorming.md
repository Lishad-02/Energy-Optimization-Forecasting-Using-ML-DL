### **1. Agentic AI for City-Wide Energy Optimization**

#### What is Agentic AI?
- **Overview**: Agentic AI is related to AI that can make its own decisions in order to achieve a specific goal, without constant human intervention. It solves problems where constant human intervention is inefficient, like, say navigation, or even becoming a personalized AI assistant.
- **Potential Impact**: It gives us a glimpse into a future with AI we can 'depend' on. One where we have AI that 'thinks for us'.
- **Novelty**: Only in the past 2 years has this topic been explored greatly. It serves as a great entry point where a lot of further research is possible. Furthermore, we're starting to see big shifts in Inference time computing combined with Agentic AI for newer LLMs.

| Enhancing AI Systems with Agentic Workflows Patterns in Large Language Model       | Aditi Singh, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei | 2024  | [View Paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/796234/articles/1236723/master/file/data/Enhancing%20AI%20Systems%20with%20Agentic%20Workflows%20Patterns%20in%20Large%20Language%20Model/Enhancing%20AI%20Systems%20with%20Agentic%20Workflows%20Patterns%20in%20Large%20Language%20Model.pdf)| **Summary:** This paper highlights the paradigm shift from non-agentic to agentic workflows for LLMs, emphasizing reflection, planning, multi-agent collaboration, and tool integration. The case study on travel planning demonstrates its practical application and effectiveness in handling complex, dynamic tasks. By adopting these workflows, the research underscores the potential to unlock higher levels of intelligence and utility in AI systems. **Novel Feature:** The agentic workflows framework, with its proactive iterative approach and integration of multi-agent systems, stands out as a novel contribution. It pushes the boundaries of LLM capabilities and offers a tangible step toward AGI. |
| Agentic AI in Search & Rescue       | Belal Elshenety, Mio Nakagawa | 2024  | [View Paper](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=ceng_surp) | **Summary:** The research proposes a multi-agent system leveraging Agentic AI for SAR missions, integrating LLMs, graph databases, and vector retrieval to improve information accuracy and decision-making speed. Key agents like Drug Analyst, Health Assessor, and Document Analyst work collaboratively to assist SAR teams in real-time. Despite challenges, such as implementing a real-time voice recognition system, the system demonstrates significant promise in advancing SAR operations. **Novel Feature:** The integration of health-specific AI agents, such as the Drug Analyst and Health Assessor, into SAR operations is a novel feature. This unique approach combines health data analysis with behavioral predictions to provide actionable insights, significantly enhancing the precision and speed of SAR missions.|
| Agentic AI in Predictive AIOps: Enhancing IT Autonomy and Performance       | Shanmugasundaram Sivakumar | 2024  | [View Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shanmugasundaram-Sivakumar/publication/386575975_Agentic_AI_in_Predictive_AIOps_Enhancing_IT_Autonomy_and_Performance/links/6757b15a34301c1fe9460f98/Agentic-AI-in-Predictive-AIOps-Enhancing-IT-Autonomy-and-Performance.pdf)| **Summary:** The research highlights how Agentic AI, integrated within Predictive AIOps, can revolutionize IT operations. By automating anomaly detection, resource optimization, and issue resolution, the system reduces downtime, enhances efficiency, and minimizes human intervention. The paper also discusses the challenges of implementing self-sufficient AI systems, emphasizing the importance of governance and data quality. **Novel Feature:** The autonomous decision-making capabilities of Agentic AI, supported by reinforcement learning, stand out. These enable systems to self-heal and adapt dynamically to IT infrastructure changes, marking a significant step toward fully autonomous IT environments.|
| Agentic Relationship Dynamics in Human-AI Collaboration: A Study of Interactions with GPT-based gentic Information Systems Artifacts       | Bj√∂rn Svensson, Christina Keller | 2024  | [View Paper](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/0db8344c-6e60-42c0-af45-744ec0b3a822/content)| **Summary:** Although conflicting with our vision, this paper explores the agentic relationship dynamics between humans and GPT-based AI systems, focusing on task delegation in programming contexts. It identifies key dynamics that influence collaboration, such as the importance of common understanding, cognitive load reduction, and human intervention to guide AI behavior. The findings emphasize the complementary nature of human-AI partnerships and offer practical insights into improving such collaborations. **Novel Feature:** The study introduces the concept of "breaking thought loops" in GPT-based systems, where human agents proactively guide AI tools to overcome repetitive or narrow decision-making. This highlights the need for human expertise to complement AI limitations in dynamic and complex scenarios.|

### **Proposed Project: Agentic AI for City-Wide Energy Optimization**

#### Datasets
| Dataset Name | Source   | Year   | Link   | Description / Notes |
|--------------|----------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Power Consumption of Tetouan City | UCI | 2023   | [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/849/power+consumption+of+tetouan+city) | Contains time-series data of household electricity usage in kilowatt-hours, including global active power, voltage, and energy sub-metering, recorded at one-minute intervals over four years. (52K+ Instances, 6 Features) |

#### **Research Questions:**
- What problem are we solving here?
    - The problem this project addresses is inefficient energy distribution and management in urban areas, which leads to Energy Waste and Peak Load Challenges (leading to higher costs)

#### **Novelty:**
- This project combines Agentic AI principles with dynamic energy optimization, addressing urban energy challenges in innovative ways that traditional systems or simple forecasting models cannot.

#### Challenges
- What are the anticipated challenges in researching or implementing this topic?
  - Agentic AI may be very difficult to implement in the given time frame (as we will need to implement reflection, planning, and learning).
  - It will be difficult to create individual agents, i.e, the Forecasting Agent (which will predict demand), the Recommendation Agent (which will suggest load management strategies), and a Reflection Agent (which will evaluate predictions and outcomes), and **then** implement communication between agents for decision-making; in the limited time of 10 weeks.
