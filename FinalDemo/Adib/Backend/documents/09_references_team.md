# GridGenius: Team and References

**Team:**
GridGenius was developed by the team 'Human Forgetting' at North South University, consisting of:
*   Adib Ar Rahman Khan
*   Aurongojeb Lishad
*   Pranoy Saha
*   Sadia Islam Mou

**Inspirations and References:**
The project drew inspiration and referenced the following papers, particularly in the context of energy forecasting for Bangladesh:
