# GridGenius: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

**Key Findings from Analyzing the Bangladesh Energy Dataset (2020-2024):**

*   **Regional Generation:** Cumilla, Khulna, and Rajshahi are major energy-consuming/generating zones. Dhaka shows surprisingly lower energy intake despite high population density, possibly due to distributed generation strategies or prioritizing industrial zones. This suggests a need to review distribution for equitable access, especially in urban hubs.
*   **Energy Demand Distribution:** Demand is spread out but slightly skewed right (higher demand is more frequent). The most frequent demand range is **12,000 - 14,000 MW**.
*   **Energy Generation Distribution:** Generation is clearly skewed right, with the most frequent value around **15,000 MW**.
*   **Temperature Distribution:** The most frequent temperature range in Bangladesh is **28°C - 31°C**.
*   **Seasonal Impact:**
    *   More records exist for Higher Temperature Seasons (roughly March-October) than Lower Temperature Seasons (Nov-Feb), indicating moderate-to-high temperatures dominate the year.
    *   Both Energy Demand and Generation follow clear cyclic patterns, being **lower in Lower Temp Seasons** and **higher in Higher Temp Seasons** (peaking April-September).
    *   The **Demand-Generation Gap** is notably higher (worse inefficiency/shortfall potential) during the Lower Temperature Season (Nov-Feb), indicating forecasting challenges during cooler months.
*   **Holiday Impact:** Unexpectedly, Energy Demand on **Holidays is lower** than on Non-Holidays. This is likely because:
    *   Major holidays (Eid, Christmas, New Year's) often fall in the Lower Temp season when demand is naturally lower.
    *   Industrial and commercial energy consumption (a major factor) drops significantly on holidays when factories and offices are closed. This outweighs any increase in residential demand.
*   **Demand vs. Generation:** There's a strong positive correlation. Generation generally scales with demand.
*   **Demand vs. Temperature:** Strong positive correlation (~0.78). Higher temperatures lead to higher demand (cooling needs).
*   **Demand vs. Demand-Generation Gap:** Negative correlation (~-0.65). As demand increases, the gap *decreases* (generation becomes relatively more efficient or better optimized at higher demand levels, though negative dips still occur).
*   **Demand-Generation Gap Over Time:** The gap was much larger in 2020-2022. While improvements occurred heading into 2022, frequent dips into negative territory (demand exceeding generation, implying load shedding) indicate the optimization strategies used are not ideal and require refinement.
*   **Temperature vs. Demand-Generation Gap:** No clear correlation observed. Temperature's effect on generation *efficiency* seems inconclusive from this data alone.
*   **Outliers/Anomalies:** Extreme gaps in Demand vs. Generation suggest forecasting errors or operational inefficiencies needing attention.
